# Implementation Examples #

This folder holds all example implementations which were used in the development of cargBags. Their purpose was to explore and extend the possibilities of the framework and are provided here in case someone finds them useful.
There is no guaranteed chance that these will work without modifications and won't be up-to-date. Nevertheless, the basic functionality should still be working.

Do not use these as a basis for your own implementation, there are no explaining comments and often things are written in a quick'n'dirty way. If you are looking for tutorial implementations, use cargBags_Simplicity.

You can use and modify these as you like, they are public domain without any license.
